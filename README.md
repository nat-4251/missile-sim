This project is a simplified Anti-Ship Missile Defence simulation implemented in Python. 
It models the interaction between an incoming anti-ship missile, a naval platform, and a defensive missile in a controlled environment. 
The simulation is designed to explore how AI-based decision-making, specifically using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm, can be applied to determine effective solutions.
The goal is to evolve neural network agents that decide when and where to deploy defenses in order to reduce the likelihood of the missile striking the ship.
DISCLAIMER:
This simulator is highly simplified and is not intended to represent real-world defence systems. 
It was developed as a learning and experimentation exercise to gain familiarity with the NEAT algorithm and simulation modelling concepts.
